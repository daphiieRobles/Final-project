        <p>Hello my name is Daphne and I'm 26 years old.I enjoyed reading, writing and playing video games.I love to travel, I travel at least once a year. A funny thing is that I started to get into computers because of video games when I decided to build my own gaming computer getting the components and putting everything together was exciting to me so I decided to learn more. I considered myself a friendly person but not in a social way, more on the ups and downs a friend who would take the time to listen to your problems and give an advice, that kind of thing.</p></section>
